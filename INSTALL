NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE FILE "installation"!
THIS WILL BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY!

Currently shmyli can only be used on an apache webserver
with mod_rewrite. In case you don't know what this is,
please ask your provider if he has mod_rewrite.

We are working on support for nginx and lighttpd,
IIS isn't possible yet - we don't own such a license.

Install shmyli is easy: copy the files to your server,
create a MySQL database and run install.php.
After that you have to rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess.

Done.
