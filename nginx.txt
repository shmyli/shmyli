If you use nginx, add the following (untested) config to your virtual host file and try:

if ($uri !~ "/index.php"){
        set $rule_0 1$rule_0;
}

if (!-f $request_filename){
        set $rule_0 2$rule_0;
}

if ($rule_0 = "21"){
        rewrite ^/(.*) /index.php?short=$1 last;
}

location = /404.php {
        deny all;
}

location = /home.php {
        deny all;
}

location ~ /inc {
        deny all;
}

Maybe it will work, maybe not.
